### Opportunities for students

* Rewriting the code [fellowship](https://rewritingthecode.org/fellowship): professional network and community for college-aged women! One of the most helpful resources of my undergraduate career
* [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/): one of the best networking conferences for undergraduate women in tech. It's expensive, but I went on a scholarship:

    * Computing Research Association GHC Research Scholars [Program](https://cra.org/cra-wp/scholarships-and-awards/scholarships/ghc-research-scholars/)
    * Companies like Netapp, Facebook, and others have been known to do scholarships in the past
    * antib.org, the foundation that runs GHC, offers complimentary registration to women of color and also specific scholarships for undergraduate women and women in boot camps

* [Dev degree](https://devdegree.ca/) (for Canadian students: imagine getting paid to get a degree with guaranteed internships with Shopify)
* Summer [opportunities](https://www.wellesley.edu/careereducation/resources/technology-internships-first-years-and-sophomores) specifically for first and second years.

    * [Pinterest Engage Scholars](https://www.pinterestcareers.com/university), not current up on the website
